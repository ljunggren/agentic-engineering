# Agentic Engineering

Actionable methodology files for human-AI collaboration. Feed these to your AI and see what happens.

## What This Is

Most teams using AI have no system — just ad-hoc prompting and hope. These files give your AI the operational infrastructure it's missing: escalation rules, memory, decision boundaries, and guardrails.

Each file is self-contained. Copy it into your project, point your AI at it, and start working.

## Quick Start

1. Browse the **[Index](index.md)** to see all available files
2. Pick the ones relevant to your problem
3. Copy them into your project (e.g., in a `.agent/` directory)
4. Tell your AI: "Follow the instructions in .agent/[filename]"
5. Customize the examples to match your project
6. When something goes wrong, update the file — that's the methodology

## The Files

| File | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| [Agent Instructions Starter](agent-instructions-starter.md) | Give your AI context and boundaries from the first message |
| [Custom Commands & Memory](custom-commands-memory.md) | Session commands, memory files — end the cold start |
| [Escalation Levels](escalation-levels.md) | Defines when AI should proceed, inform, propose, or stop |
| [Shared Context](shared-context.md) | Commit AI memory to the repo — team-wide compounding |
| [CLAUDE-template.md](CLAUDE-template.md) | Entry point for Claude Code — copy to CLAUDE.md |

See **[index.md](index.md)** for a structured overview with descriptions and suggested reading order.
